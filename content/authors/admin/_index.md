I am an assistant professor in the Centro for Health Security and Phenotyping at the University of Texas Health at Houston. My primary research interests are 1) Artificial Intelligence (AI), and unsupervised and semi-supervised deep learning and machine learning in computer vision with applications in health-care and bioinformatics, 2) statistical analysis of complex data especially within the area of healthcare, and 3) big data, High-Performance Computing (HPC), distributed computing and hardware accelerator devices (GPU, FPGA) programming.

As an expert in big data and data science, I am interested in the integration of AI, HPC and big data techniques to develop actionable health care models, bringing AI models to edge devices for personalized medicine and Knowledge transfer from one domain to another. My extensive experience and in-depth background in deep learning and machine learning with expertise in unsupervised, semi-supervised and transfer learning has led to the development of AI models in various domains from radiology, pathology, biology, and social sciences. I am currently working on multidisciplinary projects as collaborating with various domain experts from radiology, pathology, dentistry, and neurology.
